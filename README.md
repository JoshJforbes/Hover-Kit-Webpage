# Hover-Kit-Webpage
This project is supposed to show the the nice animations that can be done with pure HTML & CSS. This was most definetly a nice learning curve for me. I wanted to get to test my limits in these animations, and I also wanted to make it an open sourse so maybe others can get a few ideas from it.
